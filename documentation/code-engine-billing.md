## Code Engine Billing

**------------------**
**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**
**------------------**

In this section we will explain the simplicity of [billing when using Code Engine](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-pricing).  As each tenant will be deployed as an individual Code Engine application, we will demonstrate how standard IBM Cloud tools can be used to determine per-tenant costs.

Each tenant will have their own service instances for Postgres and AppId, so we will show how standard IBM Cloud billing can be used to see costs per service instance (or resource group, if we decide to organise the services in this way).
