## Observability (logging, monitoring, vulnerabilities)

Visibility of OpenShift and Kubernetes clusters on IBM Cloud can easily be enhanced by utilizing existing IBM Cloud services.  In this section, we will:

* Provide a brief summary of how [IBM Log Analysis](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-getting-started) can be used to manage system and application logs.  We will demonstrate how the sample application's logs can be filtered or searched, identifying logs on a per tenant basis for example.
* Provide a brief summary of how [IBM Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-getting-started) can be used to gain operational visibility into the performance and health of the applications (e.g. the k8s deployments for each tenant), services (e.g. Postgres instances), and platforms (e.g. the health of the entire OpenShift or IBM Kubernetes Service cluster) 
* Provide a brief summary of how the [IBM Security and Compliance Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started) is embedded into our DevSecOps toolchains, and how it can be used to achieve a continuously secure and compliant development environment.  We will discuss collecting audit information and regulated workloads, and using automation to avoid catastrophic mistakes.
